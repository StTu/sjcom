				<title>A lesson in stopping</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time now I have pushed my self to run further, faster and harder; this year has been the pinnacle of that with some of my heaviest running months and one of my lowest. Resulting in running over 1000miles in a year, an enormous unplanned achievement. But being plagued by persistent injuries of many varieties, I pushed on and didn’t listen to the needs of my body. Hoping and praying, that it wasn’t serious. Amazingly I have survived through, but as the year comes to a close, I’m doing a conservative Advent Running period and slowing down to enjoy time with my dog, Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running (and walking) Lisbon marathon I came back with an aim to do Pisa marathon just two months later to be confident in saying I had run a marathon this year. It is incredible how psychologically I had convinced myself that this was my aim for the year and I would push myself to achieve it. But a terrible tumble pushed my multiple times already injured ankle over the top.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Leaving UCL meal with Tim's group</title>
				
				
					<description>After being with Tim Weyrich's group for almost a year and a half yesterday
we had our final group lunch and a cheeky beer. It has been great working with everyone at UCL,
not just in the immediate group and in that vain more shenanigans to come.</description>

				<title>Transferring old book image style to real world photos</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;
Style transfer has become a popular area of research and with public applications such as Prisma based on Neural Style Transfer [Gatys'15]. Earlier this week I wanted to answer the question does it really work for understanding the larger style and context. In contrast to [Wang'13] where they learnt an artistic stroke style, how does it compare. The British Library Flickr 1m+ dataset [BL'13] provides an interesting application of this, where there is an inherent style for transferring. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Cheddar Gorge Relish Run</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;
As I continue my crazy running activities I take another shot at the Relish Run Cheddar Gorge half marathon. A great route that takes you up over the hills surrounding Cheddar and past the trig point with views over Weston-super-Mare, my home town. 
&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>San Francisco Second Half Marathon</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;
I've been running for a few years now, doing as many runs as I can a year. Granted my training routine isn't very vigorous, but just doing the run is great fun. After attending SIGGRAPH this year, I passed through San Francisco on my drive up the coast. As any avid runner would, if there a race you can do you do. So I ran the San Francisco Second Half Marathon!
&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting back to books</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;
When I was younger I never got into reading novels sadly. I have tried throughout my adult life to try to get into them, but sadly it is always a challenge to stick with them. Often I find the demands of my work a massive distraction result in me not wanting to sit and read more. I dabbled into Audiobooks that I recommend massively, but loosing my commute broke this. So I'm going to try listen while cycling to work! 
&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Working with the British Library Dataset</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year &lt;a href=&quot;http://tim.weyri.ch&quot;&gt;Tim Weyrich&lt;/a&gt; directed me onto a dataset published by the British Library and since then my research has focused heavily around this. Within Computer Vision it is unusual to get a large dataset not skewed to achieve a specific research goal. Sometimes datasets can be repurposed, but this is requires extensive effort to get the data in its rawest form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British Library dataset is a quite literally a &quot;dump&quot; of all the unknown to OCR elements from the book scanning performed by Microsoft. Therefore is not just a collection of line art imagery, but also of elaborate charachters or section embroidery.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Moving to Jekyll</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;After many (and many) years of using dynamic CMS, I have decided to take the plunge and move to an old school methodology -- static websites. Well when I say &quot;static&quot;, I mean offline generated site, I'm not crazy after all. I don't want to spend the next years of my life changing tiny global settings on my website, but more I just don't see the need to actually have a heavy database driven site running all the time, when to be honest I don't often update the site.&lt;/p&gt;
