## About
Postdoctoral Researcher at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) working on 3D scene understanding with Dr Alessio Del Bue. Prior to which I worked at University College London (UCL) as a Research Associate working with Tim Weyrich working on 3D reconstruction of large relief art. At the University of Surrey I worked as a Research Fellow working on Charting the Digital Lifespan -- a big social data classification task through the fusion of social image and comments while exploring the social implications. 

My PhD, also in the University of Surrey, explored how Visual Narratives (Free-Hand sketched storyboards) can be used for Video Retrieval and Synthesis. Contributions involved approaches for Sketch-based Video retrieval and Dance Choreography Synthesis. I also hold a hBSc in Computer Science with Games development from the University of Hull.

Member of several professional memberships including ACM, IEEE, BCS; additionally part of specialist groups in research related fields. Peer reviewer for BMVC Conference, Computers & Graphics Journal and IEEE Transaction on MultiMedia. 

In 2015 completed my PhD. In 2013 I visited INESC-ID for internship looking at how Sketched Visual Narrative driven dance choreographic synthesis could integrate the user into the synthesis of new video sequences. Completed transfer from MPhil to PhD Candidate in May 2011. Previously attended the University of Hull where completed a BSc in Computer Science with Games Development(2:1).  

Additionally I have been working for JCS Technology for over 10 years as IT Manager. Previously I have worked as a teaching assistant for University of Surrey in several courses including the subjects of Computer Vision and Programming. During my hBSc at the University of Hull I worked as a representative to new students.
